The site was originally developed using Drupal 6 and over the past 4 months we have been moving it piece by piece over to Drupal 7.</p><p>The transition has gone fairly smooth although we\'ve had our share of issues to deal with due to the multiple Drupal versions running side by side. For instance, our user base is still in the Drupal 6 database so we had to figure out a way to pull the user session information over to the Drupal 7 code. This wasn\'t an overly difficult task, but just one of several hurdles we\'ve had to overcome during this transition.</p><p>All of the career data used by the site is stored outside of Drupal, which is not a typical solution for a Drupal website. This was an original requirement so all the data is pulled into the application via REST calls, which are built within the Zend framework.</p><p>Visit <a href=\'http://www.vcn.org\' target=\'_blank\'>Virtual Career Network</a></p>', preview: 'vcn_preview.png', images: []},

It was an ASP.NET (VB.NET) implementation with an Oracle and PL/SQL backend. I led a small team to develop an application that tracked over 10,000 paroled offenders, with over half being high risk sex offenders. The offenders wore a GPS ankle bracelet that took a GPS track point every minute and reported to our gateway servers over the cellular network every 10 minutes, which equated to over 4 billion track points a year.</p><p>I designed the front end which consisted of a widget based dashboard along with a large Google Map allowing the parole officers to quickly view the location of their offenders on a map while giving them the ability to look at tabular data to see if the offenders had any location or device violations.</p><p>This was a very rewarding product to work on due to the number of serious crimes the VeriTracks system helps to prevent.</p>', preview: 'vt_preview.png', images: []},

Using the GIS team\'s building elevation data along with a tidal feed from NOAA I was able to perform a simple calculation to roughly determine water levels for the entire center.</p><p>The application was built with ESRI\'s ArcIMS mapping server which interacted with an Oracle database to display the maps. I used PHP to build a customized API to communicate with ArcIMS in the backend and HTML/Javascript/CSS to build the front end.</p><p>The Flood Predication Tool is an internal application and is still used today by NASA LaRC facility managers.</p>', preview: 'ft_preview.png', images: []},

The website was originally designed by another company and was created as a series of flat HTML files. I\'ve updated many of the files to be PHP to make it easier to maintain going forward.</p><p>Recently, in my spare time, I began rewriting the entire website within WordPress to be able to set up users that can modify content themselves as they please (and also to lessen the load of my role).

      {name: 'PHPArcIMSAPI', type: 'PHP API', description:'<p>The PHPArcIMSAPI came about while I was working with the NASA Langley Research Center\'s GIS Team. I was starting to develop the Flood Prediction Tool using ESRI\'s ArcIMS web mapping server and the requirement was to develop and host the application in a UNIX Sun environment. ArcIMS used custom APIs that ESRI built for Java, COM or ColdFusion and that was it. As a developer you would communicate with the web mapping server via ArcXML, ESRI\'s proprietary XML standard. The APIs would allow you to create objects and call specific methods which would send and receive the ArcXML.</p><p>I wanted to use PHP, my favorite development language, so I decided to build my own PHP version of ESRI\'s APIs. I knew what the ArcXML input needed to look like, as well as the ArcXML output coming from the web mapping server, so I just needed to build the PHP classes to handle it. Once I was done creating the key components of the API, I began building the Flood Prediction Tool, finishing the API along the way.</p><p>After several years of use, ESRI\'s ArcIMS product was replaced by a newer technology making the PHPArcIMSAPI obsolete. It is currently residing in GitHub for posterity.</p><p><a href=\'https://github.com/ccasad/phparcimsapi\' target=\'_blank\'>Download PHPArcIMSAPI</a></p>', preview: null, images: []},

I wrote a handful of blog posts dealing with various topics but the site hasn\'t really taken off.

As you may or may not know, getting adults to show up for intramural sports is a bit harder than getting eager and committed kids to show up for games, so at a minimum I wanted to know if I was going to have to find replacement players.</p><p>The application displayed all the games for the season in a simple grid with the next games at the very top in larger text. The games that were completed displayed the score while the games that hadn\'t been played yet allowed the user to see who is coming and set whether or not they were going to make the game.</p><p>We used this application for a few years until we decided to use a free sports team site called SportsVite.com.</p>', preview: null, images: []},
